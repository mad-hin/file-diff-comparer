# File Diff Comparer

## Abstract
A file comparer which compares two files and shows the differences between them. It is a simple application build with Next.js and TailwindCSS.

## Aim of the project
The first aim of the project is due to one of the programming courses I am taking in HKUST no longer provide instantaneous feedback on the correctness of the code in this semester (2023 Spring) and I have to compare the output of my code with the expected output manually. This is a tedious and time-consuming task. Therefore, I decided to build a simple application to help me with this task and as a practice project. Another aim of the project is to learn how to use Next.js and TailwindCSS.
